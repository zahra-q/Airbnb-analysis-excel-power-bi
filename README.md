Data Preparation/Cleaning

Since the data was somewhat dirty, we cleaned it by doing the following:

- Removing null columns
- Removing irrelevant columns e.g. "scrape_id"
- Removing missing values
- Converting data types 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Since every data analysis project should start with a set of questions and an objective, these were some of the questions we answered by analyzing our data:

1. What are the most common property types and room types?
2. Is there a correlation between host characteristics (like superhost status, or response time) and listing performance (review scores)?
3. How are listings distributed across different neighborhoods in Boston?
4. Are there any relationships between the number of accommodations and listing prices?
5. Does the host response time impact the booking frequency?
6. What is the relationship between property type and the average price in each neighborhood?

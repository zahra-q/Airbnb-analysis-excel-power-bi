## Overview

This project involves the development of a comprehensive Airbnb data analysis and visualization dashboard aimed at providing hosts with actionable insights to enhance property performance. The dashboard covers key aspects such as occupancy rates, pricing trends, and guest satisfaction metrics, allowing hosts to make informed decisions and optimize their listings.
The project uses listing data for Boston, MA from the Airbnb website.

## Data Source 

The Airbnb dataset used for this project is sourced from Airbnb Inside, which provides detailed information about listings in various locations. We took the dataset for the Boston, MA location.

### Data Preparation/Cleaning

Since the data was somewhat dirty, we cleaned it by doing the following:

- Removing null columns
- Removing irrelevant columns e.g. "scrape_id"
- Removing missing values
- Converting data types 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Since every data analysis project should start with a set of questions and an objective, these were some of the questions we answered by analyzing our data:

1. What are the most common property types and room types?
2. Is there a correlation between host characteristics (like superhost status, or response time) and listing performance (review scores)?
3. How are listings distributed across different neighborhoods in Boston?
4. Are there any relationships between the number of accommodations and listing prices?
5. Does the host response time impact the booking frequency?
6. What is the relationship between property type and the average price in each neighborhood?


## Conclusion 

Our data analysis led us to the following conclusions:
- Hotel Rooms have the highest average price compared to entire houses, private rooms, or shared rooms
- The higher the host response time, the less the booking frequency
- The most popular kind of room types being offered in Boston are Entire Home/Apt
- The fact that host is super host doesn't have much impact on their average review score
